This's a Vindigio game, now this game in developing, now it's Alpha 0.2.
You can use this code for your needs, but I want say: please not say, that 
this's your code (You can say noting), thank you.

If you downloaded Vindigio_Alpha0.1:
Start new .jar file

If you not downloaded Vindigio0.1:
You need copy Vindigio directory to libs in your user (os x), (not for os 
x) in 
user create Library directory, and too copy Vindigio directory to this 
directory (will be not work, game for mac os). After you need download 
JDE/JDK. Start Vindigio_Alpha_0.2.jar.
