This's a Vindigio game, now this game in developming, now it's Alpha 0.1.
You can use this code for your needs, but I want say: please not say, that 
this's your code (You can say noting), thank you.

For play, you need copy Vindigio directory to libs in your user (os x), in 
user create Library directory, and too copy Vindigio directory to this 
directory (will be not work, game for mac os). After you need download 
JDE/JDK. Start Vindigio_Alpha_0.1.jar.
